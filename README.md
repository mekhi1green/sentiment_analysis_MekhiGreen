# Sentiment Analysis NLP Application

## Overview
This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application that performs sentiment analysis on textual data. The application demonstrates an end-to-end NLP workflow, including text preprocessing, feature extraction, supervised machine learning, and model evaluation. The project was developed and executed in Google Colab.

## Objectives
- Apply NLP techniques to analyze and classify sentiment in text data
- Implement a complete machine learning pipeline for text classification
- Evaluate model performance using standard classification metrics

## Key Features
- Text cleaning and normalization
- Tokenization and feature extraction
- Supervised sentiment classification
- Model evaluation and result analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas and NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing libraries

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mekhi1green/sentiment_analysis_MekhiGreen.git
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
